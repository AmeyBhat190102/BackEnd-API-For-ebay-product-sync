# eBay API Authentication Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the authentication process for integrating with the eBay API, utilizing OAuth 2.0 for secure access without requiring user password sharing.

## Authentication with eBay API

### Overview of OAuth 2.0 Process

eBay employs OAuth 2.0 for authentication, allowing third-party applications to interact with eBay's APIs securely. Below is a step-by-step outline of the authentication process:

### Steps to Authenticate

1. **App Registration**  
   Register your application on the [eBay Developer Program](https://developer.ebay.com/signin) site. This registration provides your application with a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

2. **Authorization Request**  
   When a user wants to connect their eBay account, redirect them to eBay’s authorization URL with the following parameters:
   - `client_id`: Your application’s Client ID.
   - `redirect_uri`: The URL where eBay should redirect users after authorization.
   - `scope`: The permissions your app is requesting (e.g., `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope`).
   - `state`: A unique string to maintain state between the request and callback (prevents CSRF attacks).

3. **User Approval**  
   The user logs in to their eBay account and approves the requested permissions.

4. **Authorization Code**  
   After approval, eBay redirects the user back to your specified `redirect_uri` with a temporary authorization code.

5. **Access Token Exchange**  
   Exchange the authorization code for an access token by making a POST request to eBay’s token endpoint. Include the following parameters:
   - `grant_type`: Set to `authorization_code`.
   - `code`: The authorization code received from the redirect.
   - `redirect_uri`: The same redirect URI used in the authorization request.
   - `client_id`: Your application’s Client ID.
   - `client_secret`: Your application’s Client Secret.

6. **Access Token**  
   If the request is successful, the response will contain an access token and a refresh token (if applicable). The access token is essential for making API calls on behalf of the user.

## Data to Store for Ongoing API Interactions

For ongoing interactions with the eBay API, store the following data:

- **Access Token**: This token is crucial for making authenticated requests to the eBay API on behalf of the user.
- **Refresh Token**: If applicable, store the refresh token to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.
- **User ID**: Store the unique identifier for the eBay user to associate transactions or data with the user in your application.
- **Application Keys**: Store the Client ID and Client Secret for re-authentication and secure API requests.
- **Scopes**: Store the granted scopes to ensure your application requests only the necessary permissions.

## Conclusion

By effectively managing the above data, your application can maintain a secure connection to the eBay API and interact with the marketplace efficiently.
